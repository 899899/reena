# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Reena Kumari 

ðŸŒ± **On a learning journey in Embedded Systems & Electronics**  
Iâ€™m currently exploring **C, Python, STM32, Verilog, and PCB Design** while sharing my projects step by step.  

ðŸ’¡ My focus is on **building smart hardware solutions** and slowly moving into **TinyML and AI for embedded devices**.  

ðŸ“‚ **What youâ€™ll find here:**  
- Learning projects in C, Python, and Verilog  
- STM32 microcontroller experiments  
- PCB designs & testing notes  
- Small steps into TinyML & IoT applications  

ðŸš€ *I believe in learning by doing â€” this profile is my journey of growth as an engineer.*
